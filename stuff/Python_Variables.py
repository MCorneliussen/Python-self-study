# variables store data.

# these are string variables. They can be declared a string by wrapping the value inside of a single or double quotatation mark.

variable_one = 'hello' # you can seperate the variable to the equals symbol and the string
variable_02="world!" # but it is not necassary.

# you can not name a variable starting with a number. E.g. "1variable_example"
# you can use underscore to seperate words but you can not use space.
print(variable_one,variable_02,"\n")
variable_02 = 'world!'

print(variable_one, variable_02)

# Variable names are case-sensitive. 
Example_variable = 1
example_variable = 2

# Will be two different variables, storing their own data and be seperate of eachother
