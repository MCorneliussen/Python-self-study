# Int (Integer) = Whole numbers, positive or negative numbers without decimals of unlimited length. 
# E.g. 98412531631123, -12 or +51613 (the + symbol is redundant and not necessary to define a number being positive or denoting addition, but it can be used in Python.)

# Float = Numbers with decimals are floats and adds another level of accuracy.
# E.g. 123.0, -123.0 or +123.0

# String = Arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. Anything surrounded by single or double quotation marks.
# Wrap the string in a different quotation mark to add the opposite in the text or use backslack \ aka escape character
'example'
"another"
